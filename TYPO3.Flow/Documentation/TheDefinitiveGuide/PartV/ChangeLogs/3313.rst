`BUGFIX: Correctly document usage of \`\`...cookie.domain\`\` setting <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/933>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cookie domain was allowed to be set with a leading dot to signal
that it should be valid for all subdomains. This was later changed in
the current RFC 6265. Our ``Session`` implementation checks for domains
without leading dot, while the comment suggested to use it. This is now
matched.
