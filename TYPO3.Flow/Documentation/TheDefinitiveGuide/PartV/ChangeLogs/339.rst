`BUGFIX: Consider accounts with \`\`expirationDate\`\` in the future as active <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/875>`_
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What I did**

I fixed ``Account::isActive()`` behavior when an expirationDate is set.

**How I did it**

The "Now" injection is now non-lazy, thus the comparison of DateTime objects works.

**How to verify it**

Run the new functional test ``TYPO3.Flow/Tests/Functional/Security/AccountTest.php``

**Checklist**

- [x] Code follows the PSR-2 coding style
- [ ] Tests have been created, run and adjusted as needed
- [x] The PR is created against the [lowest maintained branch](https://www.neos.io/features/release-roadmap.html)

Resolves #873
